  // Linear attenuation coefficient (Âµ) is a constant that describes the fraction of attenuated
  // incident photons in a light beam per unit thickness of a material. It includes all possible
  // interactions including coherent scatter, Compton scatter, and photoelectric effect for the
  // entire spectrum of sunlight (IR, VL, and UV). Its unit is m^-1. This is used in CSP
  // simulations to account for the loss in reflecting sunlight to a receiver.
