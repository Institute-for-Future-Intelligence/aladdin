Solar trackers allow them to follow the sun like sunflowers to maximize their outputs. This model compares the outputs of solar panels driven by the horizontal single-axis tracker (HSAT), the vertical single-axis tracker (VSAT), and the altazimuth dual-axis trackers (AADAT), as well as that of a fixed solar panel. You can also animate the movement of the sun to see how the solar panels follow it."],"audioTitle":"Listen to a podcast about this","audioUrl":"https://intofuture.org/podcast/solar-trackers.mp3","customPvModules":{}}
